This repository is dedicated to my Violent Python projects. I am displaying them here publically only for my personal use, and to showcase my growing knowledge of Python and git.

There are certain instances where modifications were necessary. Even though I am using Python 2.7 and MOST of the methods used in the book will work, I have opted to alter deprecated libraries, functions, and syntax wherever possible. For example, in Chapter1 I avoided using optparse in favor of argparse.
